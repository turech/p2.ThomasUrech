	This is my car
	Good – Speedometer, tachometer, fuel gage, and engine heat gage are all clearly visible and easy to read. 
		LED screen holds lots of extra information like fuel economy and estimated miles remaining. 
		LED display also has backup camera, which is super useful.
	Bad – I cannot tell what gear I am in from the dashboard. 
		It only shows P, N, R, D, but I want to know which specific gear it is using while in D. 
		The car is an automatic, but I should still know what gear it is using when.

	This is my mom's car
	Good – similar visibility to CHR, with the useful LED display. 
		LED display shows the radio/Bluetooth setup, so you do not have to look at the mid console.
	Bad – fuel indicator and engine temperature are much smaller and harder to see. 
		No gear visibility. 
		Speedometer and tachometer use up more space, but I like the additional negative space on the CHR.

	This is my dad's car
	Good – Same dual meters with fuel/engine temp with the tachometer/speedometer. 
	Bad – gages are smaller and harder to see from far back. 
		I like when the secondary gages follow the circle instead of being the same angle as the primary gage. 
		My dad says he still has not used many of the buttons on the wheel even after owning the car for years.

	I found this picture online
	Good – Can see the speedometer, tachometer, and fuel gage very clearly. 
		Gear and odometer also front and center, but only shows the D in drive instead of the specific gear.
	Bad – Very heard to read the gages on either far side since they are so deep. 
		Gear display takes up too much real estate. 
		Lots of unused space in speedometer and tachometer unused but less valuable space goes to important gages. 
		Nearly impossible to read kilometers per hour.

<div align="left"><font style="font-family:
	Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;" color ="#555" size = "5">
	I found this picture online
	Good – uses kilometers per hour as its standard. 
		Radio station in display to prevent looking at mid console. 
		Good use of edge space on LED display for clock and odometer. 
	Bad – Fuel gage and engine temp too complicated.
		I do not need 270 degrees of information on those gages since close enough is good enough. 
		Generally, the major gages take up too much room on the edges, bleeding into their secondary gages. 
		A little more space for delineation would be better. 
		Double fade on tachometer is confusing: is 6000 rpm dangerous or just 7200?

	Common uses of dashboard
1)	Check current speed.
2)	Check fuel level.
3)	Check time.
4)	Check temperature.
5)	Look for any warning lights.
6)	Check tachometer/miles per gallon.
7)	Change radio/Bluetooth.
8)	Turn signal.
Uncommon uses
1)	Check engine temperature.
2)	Adjust cruise control.
3)	Set/reset trips, check odometer.
4)	Windshield wipers
5)	Turn on lights.
6)	Backup camera. 
I mostly use my car to drive to and from Lubbock, so cruise control is actually a really important feature for me since I do 90% highway driving. 
	 However, most people do city driving so cruise control is less of an important feature.
Controls
-	Set/reset cruise control.
-	Trip/odometer button.
-	Scroll LED display
-	Gas/brake pedal
-	Gear shift (P/R/N/D)
-	Radio/Bluetooth settings
-	Turn signal lever.
-	Windshield wiper lever.
-	Driving lights. 
Common mistakes
-	Often forget if daytime running lights are on when I turn off the car.
-	Hard to tell what setting the windshield wiper is on.
Solutions
-	Be less paranoid, the auto lights turn off when I turn the car off.
-	Have an indicator which changes color depending on if the windshield wiper is on manual, intermittent, slow, or fast. 
Unfortunately, I did not have the processing knowledge to implement my preferred windshield wiper design.
